# Tubora
# Getting Started with Create React App Admin Panel
# Introduction
Designed for simple admin panel with login functionality.For Validatin Use Default Stored Credentials. This application is used to visualize JSON data into  Grid and Card View as per given specification in the schema file.

### Credentials:
  Username: admin
	
  Password: admin123

# Conditions
  Upload Every businessobject schema and  data file undersrc/ data folder. Files suffix should be XXXSchema.json, XXXData.json for every single business object.
  In config.json file we can specify default UI View Type whether Grid or Card.

## UI Components
   1. Users can see the results by uploaded business Objects.
   2. Get results by specified constrains on schema file.
   3. See the results by Grid and Card Layout

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
